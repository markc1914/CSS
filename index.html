                    <h3>Brief Bio:</h3>
                    <p class="width-80-percent">I am a software sales engineer, and a resident of the Bronx, New York. I have a
                        very long background in server side programming in Java. However, I have next to
                        no skills in front end development, which is why I am in this class.
                    </p>
                    <p class="width-80-percent">This assignment is on cascading stylesheets. This is a topic I have always struggled with when
                        tinkering with the web, because I had no formal training, and I worked with the legacy CSS.
                        Html 5 and simplified CSS is much better.
